## Parodying the Steel Panther song

After having listened to [Steel Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Panther) for a while, I decided to start writing some parodies of the songs in a style that references [FFXIV](http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) and having fun with it!

*Disclaimer: These are just parodies and just having a little fun! Don't take them seriously :)*

## The song

> I exploded seventeen times in a row last night and ten of them gave me crits
> I had to tip the maid a hundred dollar bill to clean the wet spot off the bed, yeah yes I did
> The very next day I told the guys, they flipped me off and said that's all lies
> Got to admit I was a little peeved, Mog and Monkey wouldn't believe

> I exploded seventeen,
> Seventeen times in a row
> What a dirty flare

> I exploded seventeen times in the dungeons 'n' raids and never lost my enochian, no
> They had to mop all trash in dun scaith and some gunk in the weeping city's gloriole, stinky
> When I told the rest of the group they said motherfucker, you're out of your fucking head
> I don't lie about the times I burst, they're all so jealous 'cause they know it's true

> I exploded seventeen,
> Seventeen times in a row, yes I, yes I did
> Seventeen times in a row
> Seventeen times, I fire my flares on everything
> Seventeen times in a row
> When I was done, they were begging for more

> I exploded seventeen girls in the savage raid down in Alexander 'n' Bahamut
> I whipped out my boomstick and they got on their knees, like they were all getting ready to pray
> Wham to the bam to the thank you ma'am, then I praised my ley lines like Ququruka
> Hell, maybe where I'm gonna go, but when we get there I'm pretty sure the devil will know

> I exploded seventeen
> Seventeen times in a row
> Woo sweet, young, firey explosions
> I exploded seventeen times in a row
> Hop on those raging strikes
> I exploded seventeen times in a row
