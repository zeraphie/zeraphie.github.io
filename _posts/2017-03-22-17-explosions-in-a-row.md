## Parodying the Steel Panther song

After having listened to [Steel Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Panther) for a while, I decided to start writing some parodies of the songs in a style that references [FFXIV](http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) and having fun with it!

*Disclaimer: These are just parodies and just having a little fun! Don't take them seriously :)*

## The song - 17 Explosions in a row

*Note: I've used blockquotes to separate the verses from the chorusses*

> I exploded seventeen times in a row last night and ten of them gave me crits 
>
> I had to tip the maid a hundred dollar bill to clean the wet spot off the bed, yeah yes I did 
>
> The very next day I told the guys, they flipped me off and said that's all lies 
>
> Got to admit I was a little peeved, Mog and Monkey wouldn't believe 

> I exploded seventeen,
>
> Seventeen times in a row
>
> What a dirty flare

> I exploded seventeen times in the dungeons 'n' raids and never lost my enochian, no
>
> They had to mop all trash in dun scaith and some gunk in the weeping city's gloriole, stinky
>
> When I told the rest of the group they said motherfucker, you're out of your fucking head
>
> I don't lie about the times I burst, they're all so jealous 'cause they know it's true

> I exploded seventeen,
>
> Seventeen times in a row, yes I, yes I did
>
> Seventeen times in a row
>
> Seventeen times, I fire my flares on everything
>
> Seventeen times in a row
>
> When I was done, they were begging for more

> I exploded seventeen times in the savage raid down in Alexander 'n' Bahamut
>
> I whipped out my boomstick and they got on their knees, like they were all getting ready to pray
>
> Wham to the bam to the thank you ma'am, then I praised my ley lines like Ququruka
>
> Hell, maybe where I'm gonna go, but when we get there I'm pretty sure the devil will know

> I exploded seventeen
>
> Seventeen times in a row
>
> Woo sweet, young, firey explosions
>
> I exploded seventeen times in a row
>
> Hop on those raging strikes
>
> I exploded seventeen times in a row
