## Parodying the Steel Panther song

After having listened to [Steel Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Panther) for a while, I decided to start writing some parodies of the songs in a style that references [FFXIV](http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) and having fun with it!

*Disclaimer: These are just parodies and just having a little fun! Don't take them seriously :)*

## The song - Death to all but Miqos!

*Note: I've used blockquotes to separate the verses from the chorusses*

> Alright
>
> Yeah
>
> See-see-come on

> Fuck the Lalafell, they can tug my tail
>
> They look like the doormats that sit outside the old people's home

> Elezen can suck it, so can Hyurs
>
> They can suck each other just because they're gay
>
> They can slice off their ears, they can fume over themselves
>
> Everybody shout, "The miqo master race is back!"

> Death to all but miqos
>
> Death to all but miqos
>
> Death to all but miqos

> Death to Auras and Viera
>
> All those fucking bunnies sound fucking dumb
>
> Stupid floppy ears, long spikey tails
>
> They're not worth the crust on my underwear

> Where's Y'shtola Rhul? Where's is V'kebbe the stray?
>
> Why do all my lyrics sound like Steel Panther?

> Death to all but miqos
>
> Death to all but miqos
>
> Death to all but miqos

> Kill those fucking fuckheads who develop other games
>
> They can suck my ass with all the sponsoring companies

> Death to Teledji Adeledji, kill the little slut
>
> Kill Ilberd too and then slice off his arms
>
> Fuck Nidhogg, death to The Empire
>
> They can kiss each other asses
>
> Gaius is a fag, so's Lahabrea
>
> Doing all they can to destroy eorzea

> Death to all but miqos
>
> Death to all but miqos
>
> Death to all but miqos
