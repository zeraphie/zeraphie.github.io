This class is a version 0 WIP that I've been working on to give better access to different mono-element abilities. The current iteration is massively overtuned but I wanted to lay out all of my ideas first, and then scale them back after.

# Aetherblade
Masters of elemental power channeled through martial precision, Aetherblades are conduits of raw, primordial energy. Born from the mystical bond with a departed draconic, elemental entity or primordial existence, they wield a unique blend of spellcasting and combat, reshaping the battlefield with their dynamic abilities.

## The Source of Their Power
An Aetherblade’s magic is deeply personal, stemming from a transformative bond with a primordial being. Whether the character formed a pact with a dying dragon, absorbed the remnants of an storm elemental, or became a vessel for the will of a lich that chose death, this event is what awakened their latent elemental potential.

For many Aetherblades, this bond is not one of servitude but inheritance, a passing of the torch from a great being to its chosen successor. It could have been a beloved companion’s sacrifice or an ancient creature’s desperate attempt to preserve its essence. Whatever the source, the character’s soul is forever changed, charged with the elemental essence of their benefactor.

## Creating an Aetherblade
When creating your Aetherblade, consider how the death or essence transfer of the primordial being shaped your character. Did you witness the event firsthand, or did the power manifest mysteriously within you? Was the bond one of friendship and trust, or is it something you struggle to understand? Perhaps your character was chosen against their will or by sheer accident, leaving them grappling with a power they never sought.

Think about how this legacy influences your personality. Do you emulate the traits of your elemental benefactor, or do you rebel against them? Are you searching for ways to honor their memory, or do you feel unworthy of the power you possess?

### Quick Build
You can make an Aetherblade quickly by following these suggestions:
- Choose Charisma as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity.
- Select the outlander background.
- Choose the firebolt and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the spells absorb elements and chromatic orb.

## Spellcasting
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the aetherblade spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the aetherblade spell list. You learn additional aetherblade cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Aetherblade table.

#### Spell Slots
The Aetherblade table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your aetherblade spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these aetherblade spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the aetherblade spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Aetherblade table shows when you learn more aetherblade spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the aetherblade spells you know and replace it with another spell from the aetherblade spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your aetherblade spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a aetherblade spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus
Your aether within you acts as an arcane focus and your fuel for your aetherblade spells.

## Aetherblade Origin
Choose an aetherblade origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Blazing Warrior, Ice Sentinel, Chaotic Tempest, Earthen Bulwark, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level, and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

## Aetherpool
At 1st level, you are aware of the magical essence living within you. This power is represented by Aetherpool, which allow you to create a variety of elemental effects, dictated by your Aetherblade Origin. Your maximum Aetherpool corresponds to the value in The Aetherblade Table.

You regain all spent Aetherpool when you finish a long rest.

## Equivalent Exchange
At 2nd level, you begin to understand how to combine the Weave with your Aetherpool as a bonus action. This understanding is by being able to exchange spell slots for Aetherpool, and vice versa. The rate of exchange is for each level of spell slot consumed, gain twice the amount of Aetherpool; or, restore one spell slot that is equal to twice the Aetherpool consumed.

## Aetheric Conduits
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to manipulate your magical Aether to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Aetheric Conduits of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Aetheric Conduits you know and replace it with another option that you could learn at that level.

If an Aetheric Conduit has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the Aetheric Conduit at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

#### Aether Armour
*Prerequisite: 3rd level Aetherblade*
When you are not wearing armour or using a shield, your AC equals **10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier**.

You may consume Aetherpool in order to gain benefits according to your Aetherblade Origin:

- **Blazing Warrior**: As a reaction when you are damaged, flames burst out of your body towards the creature or object that damaged you. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 1d10 fire damage for each Aetherpool spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Ice Sentinel**: Spending 2 Aetherpool, icicles form around you in a 15 foot radius for 1 minute, making the area difficult terrain for all other creatures. If a creature other than you moves within this radius, it must make a Strength saving throw, on a fail, the creature falls prone.
- **Chaotic Tempest**: As a reaction to being targeted by a spell or attack, electrical energy surges within your blood, allowing you to teleport into an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet by spending 1 Aetherpool.
- **Earthen Bulwark**: Spending 2 Aetherpool, the ground in a 15 food radius around you becomes malleable to your magic, for 1 minute, you may raise or lower the ground in a chosen shape up to 15 feet tall or deep as a reaction.

#### Aetheric Dash
*Prerequisite: 3rd level Aetherblade*
Spending at least 1 Aetherpool, your blood becomes charged with the effects of your Aetherblade Origin. As a bonus action, you move instantaneously up to 30 feet without provoking an Attack of Opportunity.

When you arrive at the location, you displace a creature within your space by 5 feet, and may spend 1 additional Aetherpool for the energy within your blood to burst out of your body.

- **Blazing Warrior**: Every creature or object within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 fire damage.
- **Ice Sentinel**: Every creature within 5 feet must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained as ice roots them in place for 1 turn.
- **Chaotic Tempest**: An afterimage is left in the place you originally came from, and for 1 turn you are considered Invisible. To discern if the afterimage is real, a creature must make an Intelligence check against your spell save DC.
- **Earthen Bulwark**: An earthen clone of you is created where you originally came from, it remains in place for 1 minute and explodes outwards when attacked or if you will it. Any creature within 10 feet of the explosion must make a Constitution saving throw or be under the effects of the Slow condition until your next turn.

#### Aether Smite
*Prerequisite: 3rd level Aetherblade*
As a bonus action, spend 1 Aetherpool to charge your manifested weapon with the effects of your Aetherblade Origin. The next successful attack you make with your manifested weapon will add 1d10 damage of the elemental type that matches your Aetherblade Origin.

You may also supercharge your next weapon attack, spending additional Aetherpool for corresponding effects:

- **Blazing Warrior**: For each additional point of Aetherpool spent, increase the damage of the Aether Smite by 1d10
- **Ice Sentinel**: For each additional point of Aetherpool spent, increase the damage of the Aether Smite by 1d10
- **Chaotic Tempest**: For each additional point of Aetherpool spent, increase the damage of the Aether Smite by 1d10
- **Earthen Bulwark**: For each additional point of Aetherpool spent, increase the damage of the Aether Smite by 1d10

#### Aetheric Sight
_Prerequisite: 3rd level Aetherblade_  
You can attune your senses to the elemental energies around you. As an action, you can spend 1 Aetherpool to grant yourself the ability to see hidden or invisible creatures and objects within 30 feet for 10 minutes. Additionally, you can perceive elemental forces (such as heat, cold, electricity, or tremors) as glowing auras in your surroundings.

#### Elemental Affinity
*Prerequisite: 3rd level Aetherblade*
You develop a closer connection to your element, granting you environmental benefits:

- **Blazing Warrior**: You can withstand extreme heat, such as desert climates or volcanic environments, without suffering exhaustion.
- **Ice Sentinel**: You can endure extreme cold and walk on ice or snow without leaving tracks or suffering movement penalties.
- **Chaotic Tempest**: You are resistant to strong winds and can breathe normally in stormy or high-altitude conditions.
- **Earthen Bulwark**: You gain tremorsense out to 15 feet and can move through difficult terrain made of earth or stone without penalty.

#### Aetherstrike
*Prerequisite: 6th level Aetherblade*
As an action, spend 3 Aetherpool to reach a heightened state of energy, being able to make 3 attacks with your manifested weapon, these attacks cannot benefit from other Aetheric Conduit effects.

If 3 successful attacks are made, the last hit will transform into a 15 foot area of effect around the target, all creatures apart from yourself within the area will need to make a Dexterity save or take the damage and effects of the attack.

You may spend additional Aetherpool points on each hit to apply an additional effect corresponding to your Aetherblade Origin:

- **Blazing Warrior**: For each additional point of Aetherpool spent, increase the number of dice rolled as damage by 1 on a successful hit.
- **Ice Sentinel**: For each additional point of Aetherpool spent, decrease the movement speed of the target on a successful hit by 10 for the next minute. The target may make a Constitution save at the start of their turn to remove this effect.
- **Chaotic Tempest**: For each additional point of Aetherpool spent, increase your movement by 10 feet for the next minute. You can only increase movement speed by a total of 60 feet with this effect.
- **Earthen Bulwark**: On each successful hit, you may spend 2 Aetherpool to entomb the target on a failed Dexterity saving throw. An entombed target is considered restrained, blinded and deafened.

#### Elemental Shift
*Prerequisite: 6th level Aetherblade*
As a bonus action, by spending 3 Aetherpool, for the next minute you may shift the damage type you deal with your subclass to one different type in the following list: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Poison, Psychic, Radiant, Thunder.

#### Elemental Shelter
*Prerequisite: 6th level Aetherblade*
You can call upon your element to create a temporary refuge. Taking 10 minutes to gather your Aether, you conjure an area suited to your Aetherblade Origin that lasts for 8 hours or until dismissed (no concentration required). The shelter is a 20-foot-radius sphere that provides the following benefits:

- **Blazing Warrior**: A warm, fiery glow protects against cold weather and provides bright light.
- **Ice Sentinel**: A cool, icy aura protects against heat and grants camouflage in snowy environments.
- **Chaotic Tempest**: Electrically charged air disperses fog, smoke, or other visual obstructions within the area.
- **Earthen Bulwark**: Sturdy stone walls rise to block wind and provide cover.

The sphere does not prevent entry but is resistant to damage. Its HP equals 10 + twice your level.

#### Aether Crash
*Prerequisite: 10th level Aetherblade*
As an action, spend 5 Aetherpool to concentrate your Aether in your legs, leaping into 60 feet vertically and crashing down on an area within 120 feet without taking fall damage. Upon landing, the stored Aether is released, causing effects corresponding to your Aetherblade Origin with an spherical radius of 30 feet:

- **Blazing Warrior**: Every creature except yourself within the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw (creatures without a burrowing speed while inside the ground automatically fail this save), or take 8d6 fire damage, are knocked 10 feet away from the epicenter of the explosion, and are prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage, and aren't moved while staying on their feet.
- **Ice Sentinel**: The ground within the area is instantly made into magical ice, each creature except yourself must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or slip and become prone. In addition, your magic coalesces into a Frost Sentinel construct within the area.
- **Chaotic Tempest**: Every creature except yourself within  the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw (creatures without a burrowing speed while inside the ground automatically fail this save), or take 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful save. The sphere then becomes electrically charged, granting you double movement while inside the sphere. While electrically charged, any water based liquid will cause targets in contact with the liquid to increase the size of damage dice by 1 for lightning damage.
- **Earthen Bulwark**: All ground within the area becomes quicksand, causing all creatures to sink into it if they do not have a burrowing or flying speed. Creatures caught within the area make a Strength saving throw or are considered under the effects of the Slow condition for the next minute, being able to repeat the saving throw on subsequent turns while in the area. If a creature spends 3 turns within the area and failing the save, they are fully submerged they are considered Suffocating as their lungs start to fill with quicksand. Each turn while Suffocating, they take 16d6 damage, and fail any Death Saving throws.

#### Primordial Cataclysm
*Prerequisite: 17th level Aetherblade*

By spending 15 Aetherpool as an action, you unleash the full might of your elemental essence, creating a massive, battlefield-altering phenomenon that also triggers the synergistic effects of your 14th-level subclass feature, regardless of environmental conditions lasting 1 minute or until dismissed.

**Blazing Warrior**
A colossal vortex of swirling flames and wind erupts in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within 120 feet.
- **Effect:** Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 10d10 fire damage, are blinded until the end of their next turn, and are pushed 20 feet away from the center of the vortex. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not blinded or pushed.
- **Firestorm:** The area becomes a raging inferno with swirling winds for the next minute. The environmental conditions created by this ability automatically activate your Blazing Manifestation: Firestorm.
- **Lingering effect:** The area becomes hazardous. Creatures that enter the area or start their turn there take 4d10 fire damage.

**Ice Sentinel**
An immense wave of temporal frost engulfs a 60-foot cube centered on a point you choose within 120 feet.
- **Effect:** Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 10d8 cold damage and are restrained in temporal ice for 1 minute. While restrained, they are incapacitated and their speed is reduced to 0. At the end of each of their turns, they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not restrained.
- **Frozen Time:** The environmental conditions created by this ability automatically activate your Glacial Manifestation: Frozen Time.
- **Lingering effect:** The area becomes difficult terrain, and all durations of negative conditions affecting enemies (such as poison, paralysis, etc.) are extended by 1 round due to the temporal distortion.

**Chaotic Tempest**
A massive storm of lightning and torrential rain manifests in a 60-foot radius cylinder, 60 feet high, centered on a point you choose within 120 feet.
- **Effect:** Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 10d10 lightning damage and are paralyzed until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not paralyzed.
- **Thunderous Currents:** The area becomes a torrential thunderstorm for the next minute, creating wet conditions. The environmental conditions created by this ability automatically activate your Tempest Manifestation: Thunderous Currents.
- **Lingering Effect:** The area is heavily obscured due to heavy rain and lightning flashes, and the ground becomes difficult terrain due to water accumulation.

**Earthen Bulwark**
An earth-shattering quake combined with corrosive acid erupts in a **60-foot radius** centered on a point you choose within 120 feet.
- **Effect:** Creatures on the ground in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they take 10d10 bludgeoning damage, are knocked prone, and are restrained by debris and acidic sludge for 1 minute. While restrained, they take 4d6 acid damage at the start of each of their turns. They can use their action to make a Strength saving throw to free themselves, ending the effect on a success. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not knocked prone or restrained.
- **Eroding Earth**: The environmental conditions created by this ability automatically activate your Terran Manifestation: Eroding Earth.
- **Lingering Effect:** The area becomes difficult terrain, and any nonmagical objects or structures in the area take damage as per the acid and earthquake effects, potentially destroying them.

## Aether Ascension
_“I am one with the elements, a master of all creation.”_

You fully merge with the primordial forces within you, transcending mortal limitations. As a bonus action, you enter an ascended state for 1 minute. While in this state, you gain the following benefits:
- **Primordial Mastery:** You gain immunity to all elemental damage types (fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, and thunder).
- **Elemental Convergence:** You can switch your Aetherblade Origin to another subclass as a bonus action, gaining access to its weapon and construct for the duration of the state. You retain your current subclass features.

You can use this ability once per long rest.

## Aetherblade Origin
Your powers come from a draconic, elemental or primordial being that fused with your soul, inheriting its power and will. Your choice shapes the nature of your abilities and the ways you manipulate elemental magic. Each origin grants unique features at 1st level, as well as additional benefits at 6th, 14th, and 18th levels.

While your origin is tied to a single elemental essence, your mastery over Aetheric Conduits allows you to expand and adapt, borrowing from the other elements to overcome challenges and forge your own path. Whether you are a blazing warrior of destruction, a sentinel of ice and order, a tempest of chaotic energy, or an immovable bulwark, your origin reflects the elemental force that burns brightest within you.

## Blazing Warrior
*"I am the fire that burns away the darkness."*

A Blazing Warrior Aetherblade is a relentless force of destruction, wielding flames with precision and fury.
