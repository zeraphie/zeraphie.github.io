# House Rules
Over time and experience, I've amassed a set of house rules that I implement that supercede the ruleset of D&D. I tend to favour the Rule of Cool as a thing and am also not a fan of rules lawyering.

> **Rule of Cool**
> 
> If something is suggested or happens that would make the game more interesting, roll for it! This may even be known as a bullshit roll.

## Class Optional Features
These are some optional class features that you can add to augment some of the weaknesses in the classes that I've felt through playing them

### Sorcerer
Sorcerers feel a bit strange in play, even though they're my favourite magic based class, and metamagic exists, they have a distinct lack of spells that are only for sorcerer's and since a sorcerer gets their power from themselves, I thought that it'd be an interesting case for them to create spells where their blood is a component.

> **Spell Creation**
> 
> A sorcerer may utilise the magic in their blood to create unique spells that can't be copied, in order to cast the spell, the Sorcerer takes 1d4 slashing or piercing damage, which takes the place of all the spell components. Spells created in this way do not count towards your spells known/prepared, but you may only create a spell when you gain an ASI or Feat.

### Monk
Monks generally feel unfun to play because there's so many different things that require Ki, and even though you restore them on a short rest, adding at least 5 I think makes it more fun

> **Additional Ki**
> 
> Starting at lvl 1, you gain an additional amount of Ki points equal to your Wisdom Modifier

### Warlock
Warlock go eldritch blast. This make warlock do more than eldritch blast.

> **Cantrip Adept**
> 
> When taking an eldritch invocation that modifies the usage of Eldritch blast, you may apply that modification to any other cantrip using a Spell Attack Roll

## Class Changes
I try to experience everything at least once, but there's only so many games to play in, and some classes & subclasses look very uninterested when compared to the other options. So lets change that!

### Warlock
I very much dislike the lack of spell variety that warlocks have in actual usage, having insanely limited spell slots. I think a warlock would be more fun if they had a pool of mana to cast spells from instead, letting them use things like lvl 1 spells.

> **Mana Pool**
> 
> Warlocks have a pool of mana that they can cast spells with, each spell costs the same amount of Mana Points as the spell level casted at. The amount of Mana Points that a Warlock has is equal to their Warlock level plus half their Proficiency modifier, and Spells cast this way may only be cast up to 5th level.

## Feats
Some feats are better or more interesting than others

> **Spell Sniper (from One D&D)**
>
> *Prerequisite*: Spellcasting or Pact Magic Feature
>
> *Repeatable*: No
>
> You have learned techniques to enhance your attacks with certain kinds of spells, gaining the following benefits:
>
> 
> *Ability Score Increase.* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
>
> *Bypass Cover.* Your Attack Rolls for Spells ignore Half Cover and Three-Quarters Cover.
>
> *Casting in Melee.* Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your Attack Rolls with Spells.
>
> *Increased Range.* When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 10 feet and that requires you to make an Attack Roll, you can increase the Spell's range by 60 feet.

## General Play
I like making things matter, and letting cool things happen

> **Light Weapon Property: Beat Parry** *(this is in testing)*
>
> When a creature targets you with a successful melee attack, make a contested attack roll with your offhand weapon that has the Light property in return, if you beat their roll, this attack and further attacks made as part of a multiattack are made with a -5 penalty to the attack roll, and the next attack you make on that creature has advantage.

- **Critical Fails**: Nat 1s don't have detrimental affects other than failing the check
- **Critical Successes**: Nat 20s don't mean instant success (but usually does)
- **DM Inspiration**: Every session, everyone gets a DM inspiration (i.e. one reroll per session)
- **Helping skill checks**: When making skill checks, unless stated otherwise, up to two people can roll, or one person can roll with advantage (if the one giving Help is proficient in the skill)
- **Encumbrance**: No encumbrance within reason
- **Resting**: Long rests are usually once per day only, in special circumstances can do two
- **Resurrection and Death**: Matt Mercer's resurrection rules apply <https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/824054305355247616?lang=en>

## Combat
Positioning does something!

- **Flanking**: gives a +2 bonus to attack rolls
- **Critical Hits**: Roll first set of dice, and do max dmg for second set of dice
- **Healing Potions**: When used as an action, healing potions heal max, can also be used as a bonus action, but dice need to be rolled
- **Vicious Mockery**: Targets of vicious mockery don't get to save if it's a really good insult/joke
- **Non-lethal Damage**: Declaring non-lethal damage is only applicable if you describe how it's non-lethal (also if something is described in a way that's non-lethal, it will be non-lethal)
- **Ammo**: No need to track ammo unless special circumstances

## Character Creation
I like making characters. I like others making characters. I like making characters liking characters. I like characters.

- **Session 0**: Takes place during Session 0 as all party members should know each other (even if it's by just proxy/just meeting them) before the campaign (one shots exclude this)
- **Stat Rolling**: Rolling for stats, roll 4d6 drop the lowest 6 times, with at least one stat being an 18, or use this <https://codepen.io/chrysokitty/full/jOzgeMz>
- **Rolling for Health**: When rolling for health, players can't roll lower than their average (before modifiers), this includes rolling hit dice during a short rest
- **Intelligence**: If a character has a positive Intelligence modifier, they gain additional tool proficiencies equal to half their intelligence modifier (rounded up)
- **Multiclassing**: No initial multi-classing, during the course of the campaign multi-classing may become available, but only one other class and must be roleplayed
- **Homebrew**: Classes/races/spells are preferably not to be used, but ask regardless (if it's to be considered, it must fit with the setting)
