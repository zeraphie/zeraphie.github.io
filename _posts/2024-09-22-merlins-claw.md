I really enjoy how Feixiao plays in Honkai: Star Rail, and think that it could provide some unique mechanics to spice up playing a **Fighter Subclass**, so I made this subclass working with something like a follow up attack, as well as making it have a lot of co-operative synergy.

## Master of Arms
*3rd level Merlin's Claw feature*

Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with gunblades, waraxes, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with these weapons.

Once per turn, you may apparate 2 gunblades, or 1 waraxe. These weapons can be thrown (20/60ft range), but dissipate after the attack.

Gunblade - Light - 1d10 Slashing melee damage, 1d8 Piercing damage 20/60ft range
Waraxe - Versatile - 2h 2d6 Slashing melee damage, 1h 1d10 Slashing melee damage
## Thunderhunt
*3rd level Merlin's Claw feature*

After a teammate successfully attacks a target within 30 feet, you may use your reaction to instantly move to the target without provoking opportunity attacks and make a melee attack against the target.
## Thunderstrike
*7th level Merlin's Claw feature*

You may replace one instance of an attack action with a ranged attack, throwing your equipped weapon at a target within 30 feet. After throwing the weapon, you may use Thunderhunt against the target of the attack action without using a reaction.
## Elemental Arms
*7th level Merlin's Claw feature*

Each of the weapons in the Master of Arms feature are now imbued with the power of the elements, also counting as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Gunblade - 1d6 Fire
Axe - 1d6 Lightning
## Stormborn
*10th level Merlin's Claw Feature*

As an action, enter the Stormborn state, lasting for 1 round. While in Stormborn, you enter the Ethereal Plane, and an area around you for 15 feet becomes a maelstrom of wind. Any creature within Stormborn's range needs to make a Strength Save, DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. If they fail the save, they are caught up in the maelstrom, following your movement on the battlefield. If they succeed, nothing happens.

When you exit Stormborn, the force created by the maelstrom mashes the creatures together. Any creature still within the maelstrom at this point makes a Dexterity Save, DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a fail, they take critical damage from one of your weapons, on a success, the damage is halved.

You may enter the Stormborn state a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
## Terrasplit
*15th level Merlin's Claw feature*

Whenever a teammate or you deals damage (area of effect damage counts as 1 instance of damage), you gain 1 stack of Flying Aureus, up to a maximum of 24.

When you have 12 or more stacks of Flying Aureus, as an action, enter the Terrasplit state. While in Terrasplit state, consume 2 stacks of Flying Aureus to make a melee attack against a target.

Once you have spent 12 stacks of Flying Aureus, the target erupts in elemental damage, making a Constitution Save, DC equals 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier, taking an additional 1d8 force damage per successful attack made, or half the amount on a successful save.

You may only enter the Terrasplit state once per round.
## Enhanced Terrasplit
*18th level Merlin's Claw feature*

When activating Terrasplit, you are no longer limited to spending 12 stacks of Flying Aureus.

When making attacks with weapons from the Master of Arms feature, attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and on a critical hit, gain a 2nd stack of Flying Aureus.
