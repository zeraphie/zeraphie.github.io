## Introduction
This guide will be focussed on the general ethos that is used to play the game in a general sense, focussing primarily on Raiding (i.e. savage), but **can** be readily transferred to other fights, i.e. dungeons/trials/normal raids/extreme trials etc

*Note: This focusses on the PVE aspect of the game, which focuses on maximizing dps and efficiency during fights. In PVP there are a lot of different things that need to be taken into account that aren't in this guide*

And without further adue, onto the meat of the guide

## General terms
Throughout the game, and sometimes in higher level of play, you will be coming across various terms/abbreviations/acronyms that are quite commonly used. This might not be a full list as new terms are added all the time, but Iâ€™ll try to keep it up

- **MH** - Main Healer (Usually a WHM or AST)
- **OH** - Off Healer (Usually a SCH)
- **Melee DPS** - DPS whose main damage source relies on close range (DRG, NIN, MNK, SAM) (RDM is a flex from melee and ranged)
- **Ranged DPS** - DPS whose main damage source can be done from long range (BLM, SMN, BRD, MCH)

### Combat related
- **CD** - Cooldown
- **GCD** - Global Cooldown
- **DPS** - Damage Per Second (also used to refer to the damage dealing role)
- **HPS** - Healing done Per Second
- **DOT** - Damage over time
- **AoE** - Area of effect ability
- **Agro** - Enmity - Whom a given enemy will target (usually the tank has agro) *also known as hate* (Gauges are underneath each party memeber in the party list, with a number accompanying it)
- **Overheal** - Healing people to over full health
- **Tick** - Refers to the global tick timer, which is usually 3 seconds (applies mainly to DOTs)
- **Pot** - Potion (in this context it usually refers to something like a Potion of Strength/Intelligence/etc)
- **Burst** - A large amount of damage in a short amount of time, usually concides with long cooldown skills
- **Positionals** - Some classes/jobs require to be in a certain position to amplify the damage of the ability, these apply to a 90 degree area with the center of it being the direction, so you can move very very slightly to get the amplification on skills that require one then/or the other
    - **Flank** - The side of the boss
    - **Rear** - The back of the boss
- **Weaving** - Some skills can be cast independently of the usual rotation of skills, the art of inserting these skills without interupting the rotation of skills is called weaving, and sometimes requires a certain amount of SKS/SPS to not pause the rotation (usually these are buffs)

### Cardinal points
This can be a little bit debated, but I usually place north at where the tank is pointing the boss (usually only used in boss fights). I've also added the typical party members to go to the spots, as this will maximise DPS on the boss)
- **N** - North (MT)
- **NE** - North East (Melee DPS)
- **E** - East (Ranged DPS)
- **SE** - South East (Healer)
- **S** - South *or middle* (OT)
- **SW** - South West (Healer)
- **W** - West (Ranged DPS)
- **NW** - North West (Melee DPS)

### Cross Class Skills
- **CV** - Convalescence (GLD level 10)
- **SW** - Second Wind (PUG level 8)
- **IR** - Internal Release (PUG level 12)
- **BfB** - Blood for Blood (LNC level 34)
- **RS** - Raging Strikes (ARC level 4)
- **QS** - Quelling Strikes (ARC level 34)
- **EfE** - Eye for an Eye (ARC level 34)

*Note: This is **not** a list of all skills, rather, it's a list of skills that are commonly cross classed and referred to by acronyms*

### Other
- **Macro** - A macro set up by the player (in this case, usually tied to a party related skill)
