## Parodying the Steel Panther song

After having listened to [Steel Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Panther) for a while, I decided to start writing some parodies of the songs in a style that references [FFXIV](http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) and having fun with it!

*Disclaimer: These are just parodies and just having a little fun! Don't take them seriously :)*

## The song

*Note: I've used blockquotes to separate the verses from the chorusses*

> There's a place in Eorzea where all the adventurers dance
>
> There's a hole in the raid where you put your swords and poles
>
> But you never really know who's sucking on the other side
>
> Is it a boy or a girl or a lady-man hermaphrodite

> Honey, I don't wanna know
>
> Who's sucking in the alliances
>
> I'm going to the gloriole
>
> Gonna get my crappy drops
>
> Dream about Calofisteri
>
> While ozma sucks me deep inside
>
> I'm gonna blow my load at the gloriole
>
> Blow my load at the gloriole
>
> Blow my load at the gloriole
>
> The gloriole

> I know a place down the street just behind Arachne Eve
>
> Where the thing behind the hole really aims to kill
>
> Well about a gear score of 250 is all you need to get a job well done
>
> It doesn't matter if you're Xeno or Mizzteq Aran

> Baby, I don't wanna know 
>
> Who's sucking in the alliances
>
> I'm going to the gloriole
>
> Gonna fuck it with all my might
>
> In my head it's Y'shtola Rhul
>
> Don't care if it's a fucking ball
>
> I'm gonna blow my load at the gloriole
>
> Blow my load at the gloriole
>
> Blow my load at the gloriole

> Come, give your pole a chance
>
> No need for romance
>
> Come and use your boomstick at the gloriole
>
> Come, get what you need
>
> Do the dirty deed
>
> Explode over everything at the gloriole

> Fell cleave somebody new at the gloriole
>
> Buff someone with foes at the gloriole
>
> No one judges you at the gloriole

> I don't wanna know
>
> Who's sucking in the alliances
>
> I'm going to the gloriole
>
> Gonna get my crappy drops
>
> Dream about Calofisteri
>
> While ozma sucks me deep inside
>
> I'm gonna blow my load at the gloriole
>
> Blow my load at the gloriole
>
> Blow my load at the gloriole
>
> Blow my load at the gloriole

> Oh baby, here I come
>
> Oh, oh, oh, fuck
